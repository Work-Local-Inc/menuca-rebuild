# MenuCA Implementation Status
## Current state vs Enterprise Backend Reality

## ‚úÖ What Actually Works (Backend)
- [ ] Multi-tenant PostgreSQL with RLS
- [ ] JWT authentication system 
- [ ] Complete Stripe payment processing
- [ ] Real-time WebSocket chat system
- [ ] Advanced analytics and reporting
- [ ] Commission calculation system
- [ ] RBAC with 20+ permission types
- [ ] System monitoring and alerts

## ‚ùå What Frontend Currently Does (Wrong)
- [ ] localStorage for everything (amateur)
- [ ] Hardcoded user data
- [ ] Orders process as "FREE" 
- [ ] No real authentication
- [ ] No WebSocket connections
- [ ] No payment processing UI

## üéØ Critical Fixes Needed
- [ ] Replace ALL localStorage with backend APIs
- [ ] Implement JWT authentication (HTTP-only cookies)
- [ ] Add Stripe Elements for payment processing  
- [ ] Connect WebSocket for real-time features
- [ ] Add role-based UI components
- [ ] Create analytics dashboards

## üö® Immediate Priorities
- [ ] Fix Canada Post API (needs proper key)
- [ ] Connect payment processing (stop free orders!)
- [ ] Add user account creation during checkout
- [ ] Switch to PR workflow for CodeRabbit reviews

## Technical Debt
- [ ] Frontend is prototype-quality while backend is enterprise-grade
- [ ] No MCP memory bank working (context management broken)
- [ ] Missing connection between 67 backend APIs and frontend
