# MenuCA Rebuild: Build Plan Considerations and Potential Gaps

This document outlines potential gaps identified in the current build plan, based on a review of the PRD files and the `MASTER_TASK_CONSOLIDATION_ANALYSIS.md`. These points are presented for further discussion and potential inclusion in the `IMPLEMENTATION_READY_TASK_LIST.md`.

## Identified Gaps and Proposed Solutions

### 1. Accessibility (A11y) - WCAG Compliance Tasks

*   **Concern:** While semantic HTML and ARIA are mentioned, explicit tasks for achieving and verifying WCAG compliance are not detailed.
*   **Proposed Solution:**
    *   Add tasks for defining specific WCAG 2.1 AA success criteria to be met.
    *   Include tasks for automated accessibility testing (e.g., Lighthouse, Axe-core integration in CI/CD).
    *   Add tasks for manual accessibility audits and user testing with assistive technologies.
    *   Integrate accessibility best practices into component development guidelines.

### 2. API Documentation - OpenAPI/Swagger

*   **Concern:** No explicit tasks for generating and maintaining comprehensive API documentation.
*   **Proposed Solution:**
    *   Add tasks for integrating a tool like Swagger/OpenAPI into the Node.js/Express backend.
    *   Include tasks for documenting all API endpoints, request/response schemas, authentication, and error codes.
    *   Ensure documentation is automatically generated or easily maintainable.

### 3. PRD01 (Commission Tracking) - Detailed Dispute Resolution Workflow

*   **Concern:** The PRD mentions "dispute management" but lacks detailed tasks for the workflow and UI for handling commission disputes.
*   **Proposed Solution:**
    *   Add tasks for defining the states and transitions of a commission dispute (e.g., submitted, under review, resolved).
    *   Include tasks for backend API endpoints to manage dispute status and notes.
    *   Develop UI components for users to submit disputes and for administrators to review and resolve them.
    *   Integrate dispute resolution with reporting.

### 4. PRD02 (Multi-Tenant Platform) - Tenant Deactivation/Archiving & Resource Isolation

*   **Concern:** Explicit processes for tenant deactivation/archiving and more granular resource isolation/throttling mechanisms are not detailed.
*   **Proposed Solution:**
    *   Add tasks for defining a tenant lifecycle management process (active, inactive, archived, deleted).
    *   Implement soft-delete mechanisms for tenant data.
    *   Develop API endpoints and admin UI for deactivating/archiving tenants.
    *   Investigate and add tasks for implementing per-tenant rate limiting and resource quotas at the application or infrastructure level (e.g., using a proxy or cloud provider features).

### 5. PRD03 (Stripe Payment Integration) - Recurring Payments/Subscriptions

*   **Concern:** If subscription models are planned for restaurants, the PRD doesn't explicitly cover the setup and management of recurring payments via Stripe.
*   **Proposed Solution:**
    *   Add tasks for integrating Stripe Subscriptions API.
    *   Develop backend logic for managing subscription plans, customer subscriptions, and webhooks for subscription events.
    *   Create UI for restaurants to manage their subscription plans and billing information.

### 6. PRD04 (CRM Features) - Outbound Communication

*   **Concern:** The CRM features focus on tracking interactions but don't detail functionality for initiating outbound communications (e.g., sending emails directly from CRM).
*   **Proposed Solution:**
    *   Add tasks for integrating with an Email Service Provider (ESP) or SMS gateway.
    *   Develop backend services and API endpoints for sending templated emails/SMS.
    *   Create UI components within the CRM to compose and send communications, and track their delivery status.

### 7. PRD05 (Optimized Ordering Interface) - Guest Checkout & Advanced Customization

*   **Concern:** Explicit support for guest checkout and advanced order customization (e.g., modifiers, special instructions) is not detailed.
*   **Proposed Solution:**
    *   Add tasks for implementing a guest checkout flow that allows orders without requiring user registration.
    *   Develop database schema and API support for menu item modifiers (e.g., size, add-ons) and special instructions fields.
    *   Update UI components to allow customers to select modifiers and add special instructions during ordering.

### 8. PRD06 (Operational Task Automation) - POS/KDS & Supplier Integration

*   **Concern:** Integration with Point-of-Sale (POS)/Kitchen Display Systems (KDS) and supplier integration for inventory are critical but not explicitly detailed.
*   **Proposed Solution:**
    *   Add tasks for researching and selecting common POS/KDS systems for integration.
    *   Develop API connectors or webhooks for real-time order synchronization with POS/KDS.
    *   Investigate and add tasks for integrating with supplier APIs for automated inventory reordering and stock level updates.

### 9. PRD08 (Data Security Measures) - Incident Response Plan

*   **Concern:** While security measures are strong, a defined incident response plan is not explicitly detailed as a task.
*   **Proposed Solution:**
    *   Add tasks for developing a formal security incident response plan (IRP).
    *   Include tasks for defining roles, communication protocols, and steps for containment, eradication, recovery, and post-incident analysis.
    *   Schedule regular IRP drills and updates.

### 10. PRD10 (Real-Time Analytics Dashboard) - External Data Source Integration

*   **Concern:** The PRD focuses on internal data, but integration with external data sources for a more holistic view is not mentioned.
*   **Proposed Solution:**
    *   Add tasks for identifying key external data sources (e.g., marketing platforms, social media, external sales data).
    *   Develop data ingestion pipelines (ETL/ELT) to bring external data into the analytics database or data warehouse.
    *   Update analytics dashboards to incorporate and visualize this external data.

### 11. PRD11 (Customer Feedback System) - Feedback Loop Closure & Integration

*   **Concern:** Mechanisms for feedback loop closure and explicit integration with support/CRM systems are not detailed.
*   **Proposed Solution:**
    *   Add tasks for implementing automated notifications to customers upon feedback submission and status updates.
    *   Develop integrations to automatically create support tickets or CRM entries from feedback submissions.
    *   Ensure feedback data is accessible and actionable within the CRM and support agent dashboards.

### 12. PRD13 (24/7 Support Infrastructure) - SLA Management

*   **Concern:** Service Level Agreement (SLA) management for support response times is not explicitly detailed.
*   **Proposed Solution:**
    *   Add tasks for defining and configuring SLAs for different support request types.
    *   Implement tracking mechanisms to monitor adherence to SLAs.
    *   Develop reporting and alerting for SLA breaches to ensure timely responses.

### 13. PRD14 (Third-Party Integration Support) - Standardized API/SDK & Data Mapping

*   **Concern:** Development of a standardized API/SDK for integrations and tools for data mapping/transformation are not explicitly mentioned.
*   **Proposed Solution:**
    *   Add tasks for designing and developing a public-facing API or SDK for third-party developers.
    *   Include tasks for creating a data mapping and transformation layer to handle variations in external data formats.
    *   Consider implementing a low-code/no-code integration builder for simpler connections.

### 14. PRD15 (Advanced Search Function) - Typo Tolerance & Geospatial Search

*   **Concern:** Implementation of typo tolerance/fuzzy search and robust geospatial search capabilities are not explicitly detailed.
*   **Proposed Solution:**
    *   Add tasks for integrating a search engine (e.g., Elasticsearch, Algolia) or implementing fuzzy matching algorithms for typo tolerance.
    *   Develop tasks for implementing geospatial indexing and queries in PostgreSQL (PostGIS) for location-based search.
    *   Update search APIs and UI to leverage these advanced capabilities.

### 15. PRD16 (AI-Powered Recommendations) - Cold Start Problem & Explainability

*   **Concern:** Strategies for addressing the cold start problem (new users/items) and ensuring explainability for AI recommendations are not detailed.
*   **Proposed Solution:**
    *   Add tasks for implementing strategies to handle the cold start problem (e.g., popularity-based recommendations for new users, content-based recommendations for new items).
    *   Include tasks for developing mechanisms to provide "why" a recommendation was made (e.g., "Because you ordered X," "Popular in your area").
    *   Develop UI elements to display these explanations.
